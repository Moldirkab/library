Library Management System (LMS) 📚✨

Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a simple, yet powerful tool for managing books, library staff, and transactions in a library. It automates essential tasks like borrowing, returning, and tracking library resources, enabling libraries to efficiently manage books and their users.

The system ensures that the library’s workflow is streamlined and organized, improving the overall experience for both administrators and readers. It allows users to manage books and members, track borrowing activities, calculate overdue fines, and more!

Borrow Books: Members can borrow available books. Once borrowed, the system records the borrowing date, due date, and sets a reminder for the return date. 🏃‍♀️📚
Return Books: When members return books, the system automatically updates the availability of the book and calculates any overdue fines if applicable. ⏳
Due Date Calculation: The system automatically calculates the due date for every book based on the library’s policy (e.g., 14 days from the borrowing date). If the book is returned late, the system applies an overdue fine. 📅⏰
